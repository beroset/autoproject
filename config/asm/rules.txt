# rules.txt
#
# AutoProject rules file.
#
# Each line is composed of three fields each separated with the '@' character
# The fields are "Rule regex", "CMake extras" and "Libraries"
#
# The "Rule regex" is the regular expression that triggers the rule and is 
#   determined by searching each line of the input sources for the regex
#
# The "CMake extras" field is the only one that can be empty and represents extra
#   rules that may need to be inserted before the "add_executable" line.  If
#   multiple lines are needed, separate them using "\n" within the field.
#
# The "Libraries" is the list of additional libraries that need to be added
#   to the "target_link_libraries" line.  If the same library is needed by 
#   multiple components, only a single instance will appear. The ordering
#   of libraries is arbitrary.
